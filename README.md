Users select a quantifiable goal ("I will run 100 miles" or "I will meet 25 new dogs"), then update "moments" wherein they tick their quantity up or down as befits progress. The app then displays a graph of progress over time.

If a user hasnâ€™t updated progress in some unit of time (say, a week), the app will email a friendly reminder.
